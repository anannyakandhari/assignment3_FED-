ques: What does my code do?
My code creates a small “choose your own adventure” game. It shows a question and two choices. When the player clicks a button, it moves to 
the next part of the story until the end.

ques: What was my coding process?
First, I planned a short story with a few paths. Then I wrote the JavaScript to show each question and update it when a button is clicked. I 
tested the game step by step to make sure it worked.

ques: What challenges did I have?
At first, my next button and choices didn’t work the way I wanted. I had trouble getting the buttons to change the question properly. I 
fixed it by using an event listener and updating the story index.

ques: What would I do differently next time?
Next time, I would make the story longer, add images or sound, and make the design more interactive. I also want to learn how to save 
progress so players can replay different endings.
