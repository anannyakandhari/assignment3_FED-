treasure, or danger?

Path 2: The Cave
Choice: Go straight
Event: You find a dark cave with strange sounds inside.
Options:
Enter the cave → You find hidden treasure (Good Ending).
Walk past it → You find a tall mountain and see stars above (Neutral Ending).

Path 3: The Ending
Depending on your choices, you either find safety, treasure, or danger.
Every choice changes your path and ending.
